README File

1. I implemented the html and css file correctly. I did not alter the given html file. I used @media to alter what happens at certain browser widths. I used the sprite and displayed certain images from the one image we used. I did not display the images in the right order. I am going to go back and fix that.
2. Worked with Narimon Farhangi
3. 2 hours
4. README.md
