Assignment 4 Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side
4/26/2016

1. Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do

	When designing anything whether it's computer science based or any product in general, it is important to test your product and search for security and privacy vulnerabilities. This is a very important step that must never be overlooked in the design process because your product will be used by many people across the world and it's important to monitor what access other individuals have. 

	In Assignment 4, we were given access to a partner's Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 work. We were to pretend that we were hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the applications. 

2. Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
	
	A major vulnerability in my partner's code is that I can assign anything to the "login" key. Taking advantage of this, I made a post request and sent javascript, css, and html code which warped and redirected the page. 

	When I sent a post request, I sent html code for the "login" which redirected the page to a link of a Youtube video that I chose.
	<META http-equiv="refresh" content="5;URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T0utQ-XWGY">

	When I sent a post request, I sent javascript code that would alert when the page is loaded. This
	is a safe way of showing me that javascript can get through. I didn't alter any code on the website yet. 
	<script>alert(123)</script>	

	Next, I decided to see if I could alter the code by accessing the CSS file through html. I was successful and made the background of Ming's website blue.
	<style> body {background-color:blue;}</style>

	Finally, I did one more alteration to the page by seeing if I could make an image appear. I was successful and put an image of a cat.
	<img src= "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Cat_March_2010-1.jpg" alt="Cat" style= "width:304px;height:228px;">

3. Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.

	I identified an XSS vulnerability by using a harmless way to detect if characters associated with javascript were going through and manipulating the page. I used a trigger response that sent an alert to the screen. 

	Since javascript, html, and css code could be sent through the post request, I found that anyone could manipulate the site and potentially put malicious content that could completely wreck a site or even get the site owner in trouble. For example, I added images and redirected the page to links that could have some copyright content on it so using the links could led to legal trouble. 

4. Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:

	ISSUE: The first issue I found was that I could send HTML within my post request. This is a result 		of the failure to detect special characters that are associated with HTML code. 
	LOCATION: /sendLocation
	SEVERITY OF ISSUE: Med severity because a lot of the page can be accessed and modified through the 		HTML. I can add as much content to the page as I want without any restrictions. It can become 		high severity when redirecting occurs, but Ming can remove checkins requests so it is undoable, 	however, copyright and liability issues for the pages I redirect to can happen. 
	DECRIPTION OF ISSUE: I found it by sending HTML code that would add to the body of of Ming's website 	 through a post request. For example, I put an image of a cat on the page.
	PROOF OF VULNERABILITY: When sending a post request, app.post('/sendLocation'... ) call is run and 		you can see that the data for username is not parsed and filtered for unwanted characters. This 	leaves a vulnerability for HTML code to be read in as a username and saved in checkins. 			Everything in checkins is posted so it will run everything and not check for unwanted characters.	 A screenshot of the code that stores the data read in has been uploaded to github.
	RESOLUTION: A way to prevent this vulnerability is to filter through what is read in and detect 		characters associated with HTML. Such characters include: <, >, ', /, =, and ";

	ISSUE: The second issue I found was that I could send code that could access the CSS of Ming's 			webpage within my post request. This is a result of the failure to detect special characters 		that are associated with CSS code. 
	LOCATION: /sendLocation
	SEVERITY OF ISSUE: Med severity since the CSS code will just manipulate how the page looks rather 		than release any private information.
	DECRIPTION OF ISSUE: I found it by sending CSS code that would change the CSS code of Ming's website 	 through a post request. For example, I made the background blue.
	PROOF OF VULNERABILITY: When sending a post request, app.post('/sendLocation'... ) call is run and 		you can see that the data for username is not parsed and filtered for unwanted characters. This 	leaves a vulnerability for CSS code to be read in as a username and saved in checkins. 				Everything in checkins is posted so it will run everything and not check for unwanted characters.	 A screenshot of the code that stores the data read in has been uploaded to github.
	RESOLUTION: A way to prevent this vulnerability is to filter through what is read in and detect characters associated with CSS. Such characters include: {, -, :, ;, and ,;

	ISSUE: The first issue I found was that I could send javascript within my post request. This is a 		result of the failure to detect special characters that are associated with javascript code. 
	LOCATION: /sendLocation
	SEVERITY OF ISSUE: High severity because javascript is very powerful.
	DECRIPTION OF ISSUE: I found this issue by sending an alert using <script> code which would alert when the page is loaded if javascript went through. A screenshot of the alert code in the post request has been uploaded to github.
	PROOF OF VULNERABILITY: When sending a post request, app.post('/sendLocation'... ) call is run and you can see that the data for username is not parsed and filtered for unwanted characters. This leaves a vulnerability for javascript code to be read in as a username and saved in checkins. Everything in checkins is posted so it will run everything and not check for unwanted characters.A screenshot of the code that stores the data read in has been uploaded to github.
	RESOLUTION: A way to prevent this vulnerability is to filter through what is read in and detect characters associated with javascript. Such characters include: <, >, ', and " as well as the string <script></script>.

5. Conclusion - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.

	In the future, consider security and the vulnerabilities that are in your code before and after you write your code. The structure of your code depends on a lot of things and security is very important to consider before. This is because it will save you a lot of time when trying to go back and debug your code for vulnerabilities in the end. It will also enhance your product because no one wants to release a product that can be hacked and taken control of. There aren't many costs when it comes to rereading code other that it can be a little tedious. The benefits most certainly outweight the costs of a final product with vulnerabilities.
