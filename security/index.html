1. Introduction - Provide a description of the product and what you were hired to do

	When designing anything whether it's computer science based or any product in general, it is important to test your product and search for security and privacy vulnerabilities. This is a very important step that must never be overlooked in the design process because your product will be used by many people across the world and it's important to monitor what access other individuals have. 

	In Assignment 4, we were given access to a partner's Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 work. We were to pretend that we were hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the applications. 


2. Methodology - Describe your methodology pen testing the application, including the tools that you used
3. Abstract of Findings - Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.
4. Issues Found - For each issue that you find, document:
-Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
-Location / page where issue was found
-Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
-Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
-Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are important.
-Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.
5. Conclusion - You can also list future considerations and recommendations with costs.
