1. I have one css file, I retrieved my location using navigator.geolocation, I sent the coordinates of my location along with my login name to Ming's server, I got information back and parsed the JSON file. I made sure to only display the landmarks within one mile away by checking the distances because calling the mark_location() function. I also displayed all the people near me. When you click on a landmark the name and details are displayed. When you click on me (the hotdog), my login name and the distance to the closest landmark is displayed. A polyline is also drawn from me to that landmark. The only thing that I did not implement well is the fact that the polyline is drawn behind all the symbols. This makes the polyline very hard to see. It is a red line so I promise it is there. I tried to bring it to the front but I couldn't figure it out. 
MAP KEY:
	Hotdog = me
	Hamburger = students
	Taco = Landmarks
